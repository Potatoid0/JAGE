# JAGE
**J**ust **A**nother **G**ame **E**ngine

A small project I'll be working on to refresh my C/C++ and general development toolkit while relearning the more intricate aspects of graphics programming that was out of scope in prior game development projects.

This engine will initially be setup using OpenGL and GLFW; however, long term goals would see Vulkan implemented after the initial proof-of-concept is finished and I am more familiar with graphics programming.
